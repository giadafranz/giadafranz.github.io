I am a chargée de recherche of CNRS located at Université Gustave Eiffel. Here is the link to our seminar: [Séminaire de géométrie](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~romain.petrides/geometrie.html).

Previously, I was a C.L.E. Moore Instructor at MIT, and I spent the Fall semester 2024 at MSRI in Berkeley as a Huneke postdoctoral fellow. 
I completed my Ph.D. in Mathematics at ETH Zürich and I graduated in 2018 from University of Pisa and Scuola Normale Superiore.

My research field is Geometric Analysis. More specifically, I focus on the study of minimal surfaces.
